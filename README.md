<h1>CYSM019 Internet Programming</h1>
<p>Welcome to the project files for my assignment! My name is Dylan and this repository contains all the files for my Internet Programming module at the University of Northampton</p>
<p>There are two sections to this repository, the assignment files and the in-class activities. All the files within the 'Assignment Files' are for the final submission.</p>
<p>To use the website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download or clone the project.</li>
  <li>This project uses Docker to host the website locally. In Powershell or any terminal open the 'Assignment Files' directory and run the following command to initiate the server: docker-compose up -d</li>
  <li>You can then access the website through https://v.je</li>
  <li>To turn off the server use the following command: docker-compose down</li>
</ul>
